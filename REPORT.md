## 👨‍💻 Sessions

### Session 1 | 13.2. 2025
#### Work Description
- This was the introduction to the project itself, we disscused how the team would co-operate, we divided the group to team based on the specialisation, and we thought about what the app shuold be.
- We also created comunication channels, Github Repository, seted up agile board and created [issues](https://github.com/Ejdyz/Taskify/issues) on every task that is needed.
- The team was splitted to 2 teams, Backend and frontend. In the Backend team there is Novák Michal an Polák Petr and in Fronend there is Adam Jan.
- We aggreed that the end result of this project should be an To-Do list app, with responsive desing, easy login, contain shared tasks and a lot more.

#### Result
- Backend team is not familiar with web/backend development, but they did a great job learining new stuff.On the other hand Adam Jan (Frontend team) was more familiar with Next.js so he started and inicialized the Github Repo.
- The basic layout of the application was made and everybody was greeted with the production pipeline.

### Session 2 | 18.2. 2025
#### Work Description
- We started working on the app and it's starting to form a shape. Backend team was focused on delivering the database scheme, there is still needed a little work, but for now its ready to use.
- **Michal** did setup Prisma with SQLite database and used the scheme that Backend team thought of in the previous session. 
- In previous session Polák Petr was also researching login methods that we could use so we can put work off our shouldres. He found Auth.js which was implemented on the Backend and also on the Frontend.
- **Petr** then jumped on creating API endpoint for creating tasks, that will be implemented in the next session.
- **Jan** implemented the Login on the landing page, and started creating vissualy appealing landing page for users.
