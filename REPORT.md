### Session 1 | 13.2. 2025
#### Work Description
- This was the introduction to the project itself, we disscused how the team would co-operate, we divided the group to team based on the specialisation, and we thought about what the app shuold be.
- We also created comunication channels, Github Repository, seted up agile board and created [issues](https://github.com/Ejdyz/Taskify/issues) on every task that is needed.
- The team was splitted to 2 teams, Backend and frontend. In the Backend team there is Nov√°k Michal an Pol√°k Petr and in Fronend there is Adam Jan.
- We aggreed that the end result of this project should be an To-Do list app, with responsive desing, easy login, contain shared tasks and a lot more.

- In previous session Pol√°k Petr was also researching login methods that we could use so we can put work off our shouldres. He found Auth.js which was implemented on the Backend and also on the Frontend.
