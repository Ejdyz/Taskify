## 👨‍💻 Sessions

### Session 1 | 18.2. 2025
#### Work Description
- This was the introduction to the project itself, we disscused how the team would co-operate, we divided the group to team based on the specialisation, and we thought about what the app shuold be.
- We also created comunication channels, Github Repository, seted up agile board and created [issues](https://github.com/Ejdyz/Taskify/issues) on every task that is needed.
- The team was splitted to 2 teams, Backend and frontend. In the Backend team there is Novák Michal an Polák Petr and in Fronend there is Adam Jan.
- We aggreed that the end result of this project should be an To-Do list app, with responsive desing, easy login, contain shared tasks and a lot more.

#### Result
- Backend team is not familiar with web/backend development, but they did a great job learining new stuff. On the other hand Adam Jan (Frontend team) was more familiar with Next.js so he started and inicialized the Github Repo.
- The basic layout of the application was made and everybody was greeted with the production pipeline.
